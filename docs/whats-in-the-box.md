## What it's not...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A collection of different ways to do the same things ie we have taken one tool for one task approach.
For example - Nexus is being used for artifact management. Some teams may use Artifactory, and it should be easily swapped out but we are not demonstrating more than one way to do binary management in this suite of tools.

## Dashboard üìÉ

The [Developer Experience Dashboard](https://github.com/rht-labs/dev-ex-dashboard) is deployed but requires a `ConfigMap` to be generated once all of the applications have been deployed. For now run this script to generate the config map in the `labs-ci-cd` project:
```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rht-labs/dev-ex-dashboard/master/regenerate-config-map.sh)
```
