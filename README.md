# ü¶Ñ ubiquitous-journey üî•

üß∞ This repo is an Argo App definition which references [other charts](https://github.com/rht-labs/charts.git). It should not exclusively run Helm Templates but be a more generic Argo App which could reference Kustomize or Operators etc.

üé® This is the new home for the evolution of what was [Labs CI / CD](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd.git). This project represents a majour milestone in moving away from the 3.x OpenShift clusters to a new GitOps approach to tooling, app management and configuration drift using [ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/).

There are three main components (one in each folder) to this repository. Each part can be used independantly of each other but sequentially they create the full stack. If you already have an ArgoCD instance you want to add the tooling to just [move to part 2](#tooling-for-application-development):
1. Bootstrap - Contains references two helm charts used to create and manage projects and deploy ArgoCD
2. Ubiquitous Journey - Contains all the tools and collaboration software to be deployed on Red Hat OpenShift. This includes chat applications, task management apps and tools to support CI/CD workflows and testing.
3. An example (pet-battle) to show how the same structure can be used to implement GitOps for a simple three tiered app stack.

## What's in the box? üë®

- Bootstrap - Create new projects such as `labs-ci-cd`, `labs-dev`, `labs-test` and the rolebinding for groups. See the [bootstrap-project chart](https://github.com/rht-labs/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/bootstrap-project) for more info.
- ArgoCD - Deploys Andy Block's OpenShift auth enabled Dex Server along with the Operator version of ArgoCD.
- Jenkins - Create new custom Jenkins instance along with all the CoP build agents. See the [Jenkins chart](https://github.com/rht-labs/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/jenkins) for more info.
- Nexus - Deploy Nexus along with the OpenShift Plugin. See the [Sonatype Nexus Chart](https://github.com/Oteemo/charts/tree/master/charts/sonatype-nexus) for more info.
- SonarQube - Deploy SonarQube for static code analysis. See the [Sonarqube Chart](https://github.com/rht-labs/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/sonarqube) for more info.

## What it's not...ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

A collection of different ways to do the same things ie we have taken one tool for one task approach.
For example - Nexus is being used for artifact management. Some teams may use Artifactory, and it should be easily swapped out but we are not demonstrating more than one way to do binary management in this suite of tools.

## How do I run it? üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

### Prereq 
0. OpenShift 4.3 or greater (cluster admin user required) - https://try.openshift.com
1. Install helm v3 or greater - https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart
2. Install Argo CD (cli) 1.4.2+ or greater - https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/getting_started/#2-download-argo-cd-cli

### For the impatient ü§†

Tooling deployed to `labs-ci-cd` project
```
helm template --dependency-update -f bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml bootstrap | oc apply -f-
helm template -f argo-app-of-apps.yaml ubiquitous-journey/ | oc apply -f-
```

### Bootstrap projects and ArgoCD üçª
![bootstrap-uj](bootstrap-uj.png)

Create your Labs's CI/CD, Dev and Test namespaces. Fill them with service accounts and normal role bindings as defined in the [bootstrap project helm chart](https://github.com/rht-labs/charts/blob/master/charts/bootstrap-project/values.yaml). Over ride them by updating any of the values in `bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml` before running `helm template`. Deploy an ArgoCD Instance into one of these namespaces (default to `labs-ci-cd`).

If you want to override namespaces see [Deploy to a custom namespace](#deploy-to-a-custom-namespace)

1. Bring down the chart dependencies and install `bootstrap` in a sweet oneliner üçæ:
```bash
helm template --dependency-update  -f bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml bootstrap | oc apply -f-
```

2. Because this is GitOps we should manage the config of these roles, projects and ArgoCD itself by adding it to our newly created ArgoCD instance. This means all future changes to these can be tracked and managed in Git! Login to Argo and run the following command.
```
argocd app create bootstrap-journey \
    --dest-namespace labs-ci-cd \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    --path "bootstrap" --values "values-bootstrap.yaml"
```

### Tooling for Application Development ü¶Ö
![ubiquitous-journey](ubiquitous-journey.png)

Our standard approach is to deploy all the tooling to the `labs-ci-cd` namespace. There are two ways you can deploy this project - as an Argo App of Apps or a helm3 template. 

To login with argocd from CLI using sso
```
argocd login $(oc get route argocd-server --template='{{ .spec.host }}' -n labs-ci-cd):443 --sso --insecure
```
else if no sso:
```
argocd login --grpc-web $(oc get routes argocd-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}' -n labs-ci-cd) --insecure
```

##### (A) Deploy using argo app of apps ...
See: [ArgoCD App of Apps approach](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#app-of-apps)

```
argocd app create ubiquitous-journey \
    --dest-namespace labs-ci-cd \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    --path "ubiquitous-journey" --values "values-tooling.yaml"
argocd app sync ubiquitous-journey
```

##### (B) Deploy using helm ...
```
helm template labs -f argo-app-of-apps.yaml ubiquitous-journey/ | oc apply -f-
```

## Deploy to a custom namespace ü¶¥
Because this is GitOps to make changes to the namespaces etc they should really be committed to git.... For example, if you wanted to create a `my-ci-cd` for all the tooling to be deployed to, the steps are simple. Fork this repo and make the following changes there:

1. Run `set-namespace.sh $ci_cd $dev $test` where `$ci_cd $dev $test` are the namespaces you would like to bootstrap eg `./set-namespace.sh my-ci-cd my-dev my-test`. This will update the following files: 
* `bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml`: the `ci_cd_namesapce` and argocd namespace `namespace: "my-ci-cd"`.
* `ubiquitous-journey/values-tooling.yaml`: the `destination: &ci_cd_ns my-ci-cd`
* `example-deployment/values-applications.yaml`: the `destination: &ci_cd_ns my-dev`
* `argo-app-of-apps.yaml`: the `destination: my-ci-cd`

2. Manually update `argo-app-of-apps.yaml` to point `source:` to `MY FORK` instead of `rht-labs`. Update the branch from `master` to your `branchname` if you are not on master in your fork.

3. üåàIf there is more than one ArgoCD instance in your cluster, update `instancelabel` parameter to a unique value in `bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml` file.
e.g: `instancelabel: mycompany.com/myapps`

4. Git commit this change to your fork and run the following Helm Command:
```
helm template --dependency-update -f bootstrap/values-bootstrap.yaml bootstrap   | oc apply -f-
```
_FYI if you're feeling lazy, you can override the values on the commandline directly but rememeber - this is GitOps üêô! So don't do that please üòá_

5. Login to ArgoCD as described in [Tooling](#Tooling) section.

6. Run argo create app replacing `MY_FORK` as appropriate
```
argocd app create ubiquitous-journey \
    --dest-namespace my-ci-cd \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo https://github.com/MY_FORK/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    --path "ubiquitous-journey" --values "values-tooling.yaml"
argocd app sync ubiquitous-journey
```
Or if you're using just helm3 cli to instead of `argocd` cli
```
helm template -f argo-app-of-apps.yaml ubiquitous-journey/ | oc apply -f-
```

## Example Application Deploy üåÆ
![example-app](example-app.png)

Deploy the example app `pet-battle` using GitOps! This example project serves as a reference of how you could deploy an application as an App of Apps. The app is pre-built and hosted on quay. After you deploy the application for the first time update the `app_tag` to `purple` in `example-deployment/values-applications.yaml` and commit the changes to see GitOps in action!

Create using helm:
```
helm template catz -f example-deployment/values-applications.yaml example-deployment/ | oc apply -n labs-ci-cd -f-
```
or using argocd:
```
argocd app create catz \
    --dest-namespace labs-ci-cd \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    --path "example-deployment" --values "values-applications.yaml"
argocd app sync catz
```

## ArgoCD Master and Child üë©‚Äçüë¶
![child-master](child-master.png)

You can if you already have a master ArgoCD instance in your cluster that's acting as a master instance you can easily add the `bootstrap` to it to create another "child" ArgoCD instance for any given project team. This could be a good approach if you want each project team to own and operate their own software development tools (jenkins, sonar, argocd, etc) but restrict the elevated permissions to needed to create argocd CRs and permissions for things like creating projects.

1. Login to your ArgoCD master and run to create a new project to manage deployments in the Lab's namespace along with the repositories to be allowed pull from:
```bash
argocd proj create bootstrap-journey \
    -d https://kubernetes.default.svc,labs-ci-cd \
    -d https://kubernetes.default.svc,labs-dev \
    -d https://kubernetes.default.svc,labs-test \
    -s https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    -s https://github.com/rht-labs/refactored-adventure.git \
    -s https://github.com/rht-labs/helm-charts.git
```

2. If you require elevated permissions such as project create etc:
```bash
argocd proj allow-cluster-resource bootstrap-journey "*" "*"
```

3. Create your ArgoCD App for `bootrstrap` in your `master-argocd` namespace and sync it!
```bash
argocd app create bootstrap-journey \
    --project bootstrap-journey \
    --dest-namespace master-argocd \
    --dest-server https://kubernetes.default.svc \
    --repo https://github.com/rht-labs/ubiquitous-journey.git \
    --path "bootstrap" --values "values-bootstrap.yaml"
argocd app sync bootstrap-journey
```

4. Your new ArgoCD instance should spin up. You can now connect your `ubiquitous-journey` or `example-deployment` to it be following the instructions above

## Cleaning up ArgoCD Apps üßπ
Sometime ArgoCD `Application` CRs can get stuck after they've been deleted and cause funky issues.
This is particularly annoying while testing with multiple ArgoCD instances.
To *force delete* the application CRs run the `force-delete-application-cr.sh` script pointing to the namespace your `Application` CRs are stored. This will remove the `Finalizers`.
```
oc login ...
./force-delete-application-cr.sh labs-ci-cd
```

## How can I bring my own tooling?

TODO - add some instructions for adding:
1) new helm charts
2) new Operators etc

## Metrics üìâ

By setting `argocd.metrics.enabled: true` in `values-bootstrap.yaml`, promethus and grafana are deployed by the operator to capture argocd metrics.

An example of the latest grafana dashboard for argocd is available here
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/master/examples/dashboard.json
